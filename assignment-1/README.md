# Assignment 1
In the graph text files, there will be three columns. The first two columns will correspond to nodes u and v, respectively that form the edge (u, v). The last column is the edge weight of that edge.

For the heuristic file, each node's ID is stored in the first column while the second is its heuristic. This heuristic measures, in some units of distance, how far a node is from the goal. For the `test_graph.txt` the goal node is node #7. For `edges.txt`, the goal node ID is 105012740.
